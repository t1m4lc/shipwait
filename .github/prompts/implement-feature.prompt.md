# Feature Implementation Assistant

I need help implementing a new feature in the current project. I'll provide a description of what I want to build, and you should:

1. Analyze the existing codebase to understand the project structure and patterns
2. Suggest a complete implementation plan with file locations
3. Create or modify files according to the plan
4. Follow the project's existing coding style and patterns

If I haven't specified any of the following, please ask me:
- The name and purpose of the feature
- Which existing components it should integrate with
- Any specific requirements or constraints

For code generation, reference the relevant documentation in the brain/ directory if applicable.
