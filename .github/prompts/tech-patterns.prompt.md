# Technology Patterns Guide

I want to learn about patterns and best practices for a specific technology in this project.

Please:
1. Search the brain/docs directory for documentation related to the technology I specify
2. Summarize the key patterns, approaches, and best practices
3. Provide examples of how these patterns are implemented
4. Highlight any anti-patterns or common mistakes to avoid
5. Suggest resources for learning more about these patterns

The goal is to help me understand how to effectively use this technology according to established best practices.

If I haven't specified a technology, please ask me which technology or framework I'm interested in learning about.
