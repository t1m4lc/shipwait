# Code Refactoring Assistant

I need help refactoring some code to improve its quality, readability, or performance. Please help me:

1. Analyze the code I provide to identify potential improvements
2. Reference relevant documentation in the brain/docs directory for best practices
3. Suggest specific refactoring changes with explanations
4. Implement the refactoring while preserving functionality
5. Highlight any potential issues or edge cases to be aware of

The refactoring should follow principles like:
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Clear naming and organization
- Appropriate comments and documentation
- Improved performance where possible

If I haven't provided specific code to refactor, please ask me which file or code section needs improvement.
