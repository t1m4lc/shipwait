# Debug Assistant

I'm facing an issue in my code. Please help me debug it by:

1. Understanding the problem description I provide
2. Examining the relevant code files
3. Checking for common issues related to the technologies involved
4. Referencing the brain/docs directory for relevant documentation
5. Suggesting specific diagnostic steps or terminal commands I can run
6. Proposing a solution with explanation

Whenever possible, refer to specific documentation sections in the brain/docs directory that might be relevant to the issue I'm facing. This will help me understand the proper patterns and approaches.

If my problem description is unclear, ask me for:
- The specific error message or unexpected behavior
- The context in which it occurs
- What technologies or frameworks are involved
- What steps I've already tried
