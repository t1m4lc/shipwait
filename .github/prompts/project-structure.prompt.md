# Project Structure Analysis

Please analyze the current project structure and provide a hierarchical overview of:

1. Main directories and their purpose
2. Key files and their roles
3. How the components are organized
4. Any architectural patterns you can identify

Make your response clear and structured, using headings, bullet points, and code blocks where appropriate.
