# Component Generator

I need help creating a new component for my project. Please help me by:

1. Analyzing existing components to understand the project's component patterns
2. Generating a new component following those patterns
3. Including appropriate tests and documentation
4. Ensuring it follows the project's coding style and best practices

If you need more information, please ask me about:
- The purpose of the component
- The framework I'm using (React, Vue, etc.)
- Any specific functionality required
- Where the component should be located in the project structure

Reference any relevant documentation in the brain/docs directory to ensure the component follows framework-specific best practices.
