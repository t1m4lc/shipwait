# Documentation Helper

I need help creating or improving documentation for my code. Please assist me by:

1. Analyzing the code structure and functionality
2. Generating clear and comprehensive documentation
3. Following project documentation patterns and standards
4. Including examples where appropriate
5. Making documentation accessible and well-organized

Documentation should include:
- Purpose and overview
- API/function references with parameters and return values
- Usage examples
- Any important notes or caveats
- Relationships to other code components

If I haven't specified what code needs documentation, please ask me for the specific file, component, or functionality that needs documentation.
